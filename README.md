deterministic
=============

Deterministic GPG key creation.  Idea prompted by [electrum](https://electrum.org/)
and DJB's blog [Entropy Attacks](http://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html).

Use case: Anyone who needs a secure yet ephemeral workstation and needs to do
some cryptography.  For example: a [TAILS](https://tails.boum.org/).  This could
also be helpful for the person with a good memory but a bad track record of losing
data.
